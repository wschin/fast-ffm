# fast-ffm
An Improved Algorithm for Training Field-aware Factorization Machines (FFM)

# Motivation
Existing FFM training algorithms are not efficient when some fields contain a huge number of features because they may calculate the pair-wise interactions implicitly. The proposed method reduces the complexity from square to linear of feature numebr.

# Compile the latex note to see the detailed algorithm
Assume that you're using Linux or Cygwin with all necessary Latex packages installed. You can simply type
```
make
```
in your command line.
